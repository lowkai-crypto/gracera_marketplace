# Portal Navigation (Sidebar Spec)

Defines the dashboard sidebar contents per role. Per
[Data Model](09-data-model.md) §3.1, this is **one shell with a top-nav
role switcher**, not one codebase per role — the switcher renders one
entry per role a user holds (`user_roles`) and shows that role's
`role_features` in the sidebar. The tables below are the **default seed
data** for the `supplier` and `buyer` system roles' `role_features` rows
— not a hardcoded frontend list. An admin can customize either role's
assigned features away from these defaults, or stand up an entirely new
role with its own set, via [Admin Ops](20-admin-ops-spec.md) §13.

The platform's third launch role, `admin`, doesn't get a sidebar table
here — its portal is the internal admin dashboard, fully speced in
[Admin Ops](20-admin-ops-spec.md) §§1–13, and it isn't a `role_features`
consumer in the same sense (internal admin capabilities are gated by a
separate internal admin-roles enum, [20](20-admin-ops-spec.md) §1).

Each item cites the doc section that defines the underlying feature. Build
status is tracked separately in [Roadmap](13-roadmap.md); this doc is IA
only, not a completion record.

## Not a sidebar item: RAG

RAG isn't its own nav destination — it's the engine behind **My Profile**'s
fill-in paths ("Upload a catalog," "Paste your website") and the public,
no-login Sourcing Query Tool ([03](03-system-architecture.md) §3.3), which
lives outside the portal entirely. Giving it its own slot would send users
looking for a place to "do RAG" that doesn't need to exist.

## Cross-cutting, not in either sidebar

- **Dispute Center** ([08](08-deal-workflow.md) §7) — an action inside a
  specific Deal, not a standalone list, until volume justifies one.
- **Human Translator booking** ([08](08-deal-workflow.md) §10) —
  contextual inside Deal Room/Messages, not a nav item.

---

## Implementation Plans

Per-item build plans, grounded against the tables that already exist in
[`packages/db/src/schema.ts`](../packages/db/src/schema.ts) (`users`,
`supplier_profiles`, `product_lines`, `buyer_profiles`,
`sourcing_requests` — only these five are live today) versus the fuller
set speced in [09](09-data-model.md) (`matches`, `deals`, `messages`,
`rfqs`, `quotes`, `quote_line_items`, `certifications`, `disputes`,
`group_rfqs`, `group_rfq_members`, `deal_contracts`, `company_contacts`,
`reviews`, `categories` — all speced, none built yet). Phase references
are to [13](13-roadmap.md).

**Schema gaps formalized into [09](09-data-model.md)** — these four
weren't speced anywhere before this pass; they've since been added to the
data model doc and are referenced by name below:

- `subscriptions` — backs tier/billing state per role; no table existed
  despite [13](13-roadmap.md) M1.1 shipping "subscription tiers with
  offline payment support" in Phase 1. Blocks Billing and all
  Pro/Enterprise feature gates (AI-Brain, Negotiation Coach).
- `ai_brain_conversations` / `ai_brain_messages` — AI-Brain's chat
  history persistence model.
- `referrals` — logs the click/handoff for Trade Finance, Logistics, and
  Buyer Protection ("referral at Deal Room entry" per
  [08](08-deal-workflow.md)) for commission reconciliation
  ([15](15-monetization.md) §4).
- `notification_preferences` + `users.preferred_language` — storage for
  the preference controls [21](21-notifications-email-spec.md) describes.

### Shared across both contexts

#### Dashboard
- **Status:** partially built — `apps/web/src/app/onboarding/page.tsx`
  serves this role today (profile summary cards), but it's a first-run
  hub, not an ongoing-use dashboard.
- **Data model:** none new — aggregates over `matches`/`deals`/
  `sourcing_requests` once those exist.
- **Backend:** `GET /api/dashboard/summary` — counts and recent activity
  per active context; can stay client-side aggregation of existing list
  endpoints until volume makes a dedicated endpoint worth it.
- **Frontend:** split today's `/onboarding` into a first-run flow (create
  profile) and a `/dashboard` ongoing hub once Matches/Deals exist to
  summarize.
- **Depends on:** Matches, Deals.
- **Phase:** 1 (M1.1, current form) → real version rides in with Phase 2.

#### Matches
- **Status:** not built. `apps/ai-service` is a stateless single-pair
  scorer only — no `matches` table, no batch job populating it.
- **Data model:** add `matches` table per [09](09-data-model.md)
  (`supplier_profile_id`, `buyer_profile_id`, `sourcing_request_id`,
  `ai_score`, `final_score`, `ai_rationale` jsonb, `supplier_status`,
  `buyer_status`, `created_at`, `expires_at`).
- **Backend:** batch job running the [07](07-matching-algorithm.md)
  pipeline across active supplier profiles × open sourcing requests,
  writing `matches` rows; `GET /matches?profile_type=&profile_id=`,
  `POST /matches/{id}/accept`, `POST /matches/{id}/reject` — all already
  contracted in [10](10-api-reference.md). Match accept-by-both-parties
  auto-creates a `deals` row per that same doc.
- **Frontend:** `/matches` list, match card with score + expandable
  rationale, accept/reject actions.
- **Depends on:** at least one active supplier profile and one open
  sourcing request to score against.
- **Phase:** 1 (M1.2, daily digest) → 2 (M2.1, real-time + vector
  supplement).

#### Deals
- **Status:** not built — no `deals`/`messages`/`rfqs`/`quotes` tables
  exist yet.
- **Data model:** add `deals`, `messages`, `rfqs`, `quotes`,
  `quote_line_items` per [09](09-data-model.md); Deal Room stage also
  needs `deal_contracts`.
- **Backend:** deal auto-creation on mutual match accept; message,
  RFQ, and quote endpoints exactly as contracted in
  [10](10-api-reference.md) (`POST /deals/{id}/messages`,
  `POST /deals/{deal_id}/rfqs`, `POST /rfqs/{id}/quotes`,
  `POST /quotes/{id}/accept|counter|decline`); Deal Room referral
  triggers (trade finance, logistics, e-signature, inspection, buyer
  protection, translator) fire "at Deal Room entry" per
  [08](08-deal-workflow.md).
- **Frontend:** `/deals` list filterable by stage, `/deals/{id}` detail
  (thread, RFQ form, side-by-side quote comparison, Deal Room checklist).
- **Depends on:** Matches (a deal originates from an accepted match).
- **Phase:** messaging = 1 (M1.2); RFQ/Quote = 3 (M3.1); Deal Room = 3
  (M3.2).

#### Messages
- **Status:** not built — inbox is a view over `deals.messages`, not a
  standalone feature.
- **Data model:** `messages` table (see Deals above).
- **Backend:** `GET /api/messages` aggregating unread counts across all
  of a user's deal threads; reuses `POST /deals/{id}/messages`.
- **Frontend:** `/messages` inbox sorted by recent activity with unread
  badges, opening into the parent deal thread.
- **Depends on:** Deals.
- **Phase:** 1 (M1.2).

#### AI-Brain
- **Status:** not built — no persistent context assembly, no chat UI, no
  tier gate.
- **Data model:** `ai_brain_conversations` / `ai_brain_messages`
  ([09](09-data-model.md) §2); gated by the `subscriptions` table
  ([09](09-data-model.md) §2, §3.6).
- **Backend:** context assembly (profile + match history + deal history +
  category benchmarks, prompt-cached per [04](04-ai-agent-design.md) §7)
  in `apps/ai-service`; `apps/web` proxy route `/api/ai-brain/chat`. The
  "AI Growth Advisor" structured mode (10-question intake → roadmap) is a
  separate guided flow, not the free-form chat.
- **Frontend:** `/ai-brain` chat UI; `/ai-brain/growth-advisor` intake +
  roadmap view.
- **Depends on:** Matches + Deals (nothing to advise on without them),
  Billing (Pro/Enterprise gate).
- **Phase:** 3 (M3.2).

#### Insights
- **Status:** not built.
- **Data model:** none new for v0 — category benchmarks computed
  on-the-fly from `product_lines` + `supplier_profiles` (or
  `quotes`/`quote_line_items` on the buyer side), not a persisted table.
- **Backend:** `GET /api/insights/{profileId}` — completeness gaps +
  category percentile comparison; "Growth Strategy Engine" export
  (PDF/markdown) as a follow-on per [13](13-roadmap.md) M2.2.
- **Frontend:** `/insights` — profile health checklist, benchmark
  comparison, export button.
- **Depends on:** enough profiles in a category to benchmark against —
  cold-start dependent (Phase 0 placeholder seeding).
- **Phase:** 2 (M2.2).

#### Reviews
- **Status:** not built. `reviews` table is speced in
  [09](09-data-model.md) but not yet in `schema.ts`.
- **Data model:** add `reviews` exactly as speced (`visible` flips true
  once both parties have submitted).
- **Backend:** `POST /api/deals/{id}/reviews`, `GET /api/reviews?profile_id=`
  for public display; feeds "Verified Deal Network" per
  [13](13-roadmap.md) M2.3.
- **Frontend:** post-deal review prompt on `deal.stage = closed`,
  `/reviews` list on the public profile.
- **Depends on:** Deals reaching `closed`.
- **Phase:** 1 (M1.3, basic) → 2 (M2.3, Verified Deal Network).

#### Contacts
- **Status:** not built. `company_contacts` table is speced in
  [09](09-data-model.md) but not yet in `schema.ts`.
- **Data model:** add `company_contacts` exactly as speced (polymorphic
  `profile_id` + `profile_type`, `routing_types`, `is_primary`).
- **Backend:** CRUD under `/api/supplier-profiles/{id}/contacts` and
  `/api/buyer-profiles/{id}/contacts` (max 3 additional per
  [13](13-roadmap.md) M1.1); email hidden until introduction accepted,
  matching the primary contact's existing visibility rule.
- **Frontend:** `/contacts` — primary + up to 3 additional, each with
  commercial/technical/finance routing checkboxes.
- **Depends on:** My Profile (already built for both roles).
- **Phase:** 1 (M1.1).

#### Billing
- **Status:** not built — the `subscriptions` table exists in the spec
  ([09](09-data-model.md) §2) but not yet in `schema.ts` (largest gap
  surfaced by this pass).
- **Data model:** `subscriptions` — independent record per role per
  [09](09-data-model.md) §3.6.
- **Backend:** Stripe integration ([27](27-integrations.md)) for card;
  wire-transfer confirmation queue ([20](20-admin-ops-spec.md)) for
  offline payment; 15% dual-role bundle discount logic.
- **Frontend:** `/billing` — current tier, upgrade/downgrade, payment
  method, wire instructions + status.
- **Depends on:** nothing functionally, but every Pro/Enterprise gate
  (AI-Brain, Negotiation Coach) depends on this existing first.
- **Phase:** 1 (M1.1).

#### Settings
- **Status:** partially built — sign-out exists in
  `onboarding/page.tsx`; no dedicated settings page.
- **Data model:** `users.preferred_language` and
  `notification_preferences` ([09](09-data-model.md) §2).
- **Backend:** `PATCH /api/users/me` (language, notification prefs,
  password change); "Add buyer/supplier profile" role-upgrade action per
  [09](09-data-model.md) §3.2.
- **Frontend:** `/settings` — account info, language selector,
  notification toggles, dual-role upgrade CTA.
- **Depends on:** nothing.
- **Phase:** 1 (M1.1, baseline) → 4 (M4.1, once language prefs tie into
  full i18n).

### Supplier-only

#### My Profile (supplier)
- **Status:** built — `apps/web/src/app/onboarding/supplier/page.tsx` +
  `/api/supplier-profiles` CRUD, including website-URL and edit-mode
  pre-fill. No further v0 work.

#### Certifications
- **Status:** not built. `certifications` table is speced in
  [09](09-data-model.md) but not yet in `schema.ts`.
- **Data model:** add `certifications` exactly as speced, including
  `authenticity_status` and `expiry_notified_at` jsonb.
- **Backend:** `POST /api/certifications` (file upload via the existing
  `/uploads/presign` flow), `GET/PATCH/DELETE`; scheduled job for
  90/60/30-day expiry alerts writing `expiry_notified_at` and firing the
  [21](21-notifications-email-spec.md) template.
- **Frontend:** `/certifications` list + upload form.
- **Depends on:** My Profile (built).
- **Phase:** 1 (M1.3, upload/verification) → 2 (M2.1, expiry automation).

#### Visibility (AEO)
- **Status:** not built — no AEO Agent, no generated Q&A storage.
- **Data model:** `aeo_qa_pairs` jsonb column on `supplier_profiles`
  (gap, not yet in [09](09-data-model.md)); citation tracking would need
  a referral-log table (separate gap from the AI-assistant-referral
  tracking used for the exit criteria in [13](13-roadmap.md) Phase 4).
- **Backend:** batch job running the AEO Agent
  ([04](04-ai-agent-design.md) §6) against verified supplier profiles,
  generating `FAQPage` JSON-LD injected server-side into the existing
  public `/supplier-profiles/{id}` route.
- **Frontend:** `/visibility` — generated Q&A preview, citation tracking,
  publish status.
- **Depends on:** My Profile + `verification_level ≥ verified`.
- **Phase:** 2 (M2.1).

#### Broadcasts
- **Status:** not built.
- **Data model:** new `broadcasts` table (gap, propose: `id`,
  `supplier_profile_id`, `headline`, `body`, `target_segment`,
  `sent_at`, `recipient_count`).
- **Backend:** `POST /api/broadcasts` — composes + targets a buyer
  segment (reuses the same category/geography dimensions as matching),
  triggers email and a temporary recency-score boost per
  [07](07-matching-algorithm.md).
- **Frontend:** `/broadcasts` — compose form + send history with
  open/click stats.
- **Depends on:** Matches (shares its targeting dimensions).
- **Phase:** 3 (M3.3).

#### Finance
- **Status:** not built.
- **Data model:** `referrals` table ([09](09-data-model.md) §2, shared
  with Logistics and Payment & Trust below).
- **Backend:** `POST /api/deals/{id}/referrals/trade-finance` (logs
  referral, redirects to partner) at Deal Room entry per
  [08](08-deal-workflow.md); webhook receiver for partner-reported funded
  amount.
- **Frontend:** Finance tab — trade finance referral CTA + read-only
  wire-transfer payment history (surfaces the [20](20-admin-ops-spec.md)
  wire queue data to the supplier side).
- **Depends on:** Deals reaching Deal Room stage.
- **Phase:** 3 (M3.2).

### Buyer-only

#### My Profile (buyer)
- **Status:** built — `apps/web/src/app/onboarding/buyer/page.tsx` +
  `/api/buyer-profiles` CRUD, including edit-mode pre-fill. No further
  v0 work.

#### Sourcing Requests
- **Status:** built — create/list/edit backend all exist
  (`/api/sourcing-requests`); dashboard UI is still read-only-plus-"post
  another" (edit/close UI wiring is the one remaining gap, already
  deferred from the earlier "my profile dashboard" work).

#### Group Buys
- **Status:** not built. `group_rfqs` + `group_rfq_members` tables are
  speced in [09](09-data-model.md) but not yet in `schema.ts`.
- **Data model:** add both tables exactly as speced.
- **Backend:** `POST /api/group-rfqs` (lead buyer creates, sets
  `combined_quantity` target), `POST /api/group-rfqs/{id}/join`
  (co-buyer allocates), `POST /api/group-rfqs/{id}/withdraw`; transitions
  to `rfq_issued` once MOQ is met, then reuses the standard RFQ/Quote
  endpoints against the supplier.
- **Frontend:** `/group-buys` — browse forming pools in the buyer's
  categories, join/allocate flow, lead-buyer management view.
- **Depends on:** Sourcing Requests (built), Deals/RFQ infrastructure.
- **Phase:** 4 (M4.2b).

#### Price Compass
- **Status:** not built.
- **Data model:** none new for v0 — computed on-the-fly from
  `quotes`/`quote_line_items` aggregated by category + HS code.
- **Backend:** `GET /api/price-compass?category_id=&hs_code=` returning
  a percentile price range from historical quotes.
- **Frontend:** inline widget during RFQ/Quote review, plus a standalone
  `/price-compass` lookup.
- **Depends on:** Deals/Quotes generating enough historical volume —
  not meaningfully usable until real deal flow exists.
- **Phase:** 2 (M2.3).

#### Logistics
- **Status:** not built.
- **Data model:** `referrals` table (shared with Finance above,
  `type = logistics`).
- **Backend:** `POST /api/deals/{id}/referrals/logistics` — freight
  forwarder partner quote request ([27](27-integrations.md)) at Deal
  Room entry.
- **Frontend:** Logistics tab in Deal Room — landed cost estimate form +
  partner quote results.
- **Depends on:** Deals reaching Deal Room stage.
- **Phase:** 3 (M3.2).

#### Payment & Trust
- **Status:** not built. The four tracking columns
  (`on_time_payment_rate`, `avg_days_to_payment`,
  `completed_deals_count`, `payment_disputes_count`) are already speced
  on `buyer_profiles` in [09](09-data-model.md) but not yet in
  `schema.ts`, and nothing computes them yet.
- **Data model:** add the four columns to `buyer_profiles`.
- **Backend:** scheduled job recomputing them from closed deals +
  dispute history; `POST /api/deals/{id}/referrals/buyer-protection` for
  the escrow referral (shared `referrals` table).
- **Frontend:** Payment & Trust tab — own track record (mirrors what
  suppliers see at introduction stage per [13](13-roadmap.md) M3.1) +
  escrow referral CTA in Deal Room.
- **Depends on:** `buyer_profiles` schema addition, Deals/disputes for
  real computation.
- **Phase:** 3 (M3.1, payment track record) → 3 (M3.2, buyer protection
  referral).
